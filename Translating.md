# Translating the Pixelitor user interface

- The translation files are in the directory [resources](blob/master/src/main/resources).
- For each language there has to be a translation file
  texts_<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">lang-code</a>.properties.
- A lot of text is still hardcoded (doesn't come from the translation files), let me know if you want to translate some
  of it (open an issue), and I will add it to the translation files
- If you create a new file for a new language, make sure it is "UTF8 BOM" encoded (you can make a copy of an existing
  file)
- Translating every text in the user interface is a big task. It's OK, if you contribute only a few translations.
